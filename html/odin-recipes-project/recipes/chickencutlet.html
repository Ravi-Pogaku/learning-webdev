            <p>The best chicken cutlet recipe in the entire world (not exaggerating)</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 (4 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, pounded to 1/2-inch thickness</li>
                <li>½ cup salt</li>
                <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
                <li>8 slices crustless bread, torn into large pieces</li>
                <li>¼ cup dried parsley</li>
                <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>¾ cup olive oil, divided</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Place a large<br> oven-proof plate on the bottom rack.</li>
                <li>Dissolve salt and sugar in water in a 1-quart casserole dish.<br> Place chicken in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pat chicken dry and place on a paper towel-lined baking sheet.<br> Let air-dry for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Place bread in a blender or food processor; blend until crumbly,<br> about 30 seconds. Mix bread crumbs with parsley in a shallow dish.</li>
                <li>Place flour in a shallow dish.</li>
                <li>Beat eggs with 1 tablespoon olive oil in a separate shallow dish.</li>
                <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Dredge each cutlet in the flour,<br> shaking off any excess; dip in the egg mixture and coat evenly in bread crumbs.</li>
                <li>Heat the remaining oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat.<br> Add 2 cutlets; cook until golden brown on the outside, no longer<br> pink in the center, and juices run clear, 2 to 3 minutes per side.<br> An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least<br> 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove warmed plate from the oven;<br> placed cooked cutlets on the plate. Repeat with the remaining chicken.</li>
